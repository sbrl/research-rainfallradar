# rainfallwrangler

> Wrangles rainfall radar and water depth data into something sensible.


This Node.js-based tool is designed for wrangling rainfall, heightmap, and water depth data into something that the image semantic segmentation model that is the main feature of this repository can understand.

The reason for this is efficiency: nothing less than a set of `.tfrecord` files for reading in parallel is sufficient if one wants the model to train in a reasonable length of time.


TODO: Write a guide for this tool here.
